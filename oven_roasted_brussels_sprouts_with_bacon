ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - Kosher salt 
  - freshly ground black pepper
  - 6 bacon slices, cut into 1 inch pieces
Directions:
  - Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
  - Clean and trim Brussels sprouts and cutting any very large heads in half through the core. (It's fine if some of the outer leaves fall off â€“ just bake those along with the rest of the sprouts. They get extra crispy and are delicious!)
  - Place the Brussels sprouts in a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil, tossing to evenly coat.
  - Pour the Brussels sprouts onto a large sheet pan (you want them to be in a single layer). Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then evenly sprinkle the bacon pieces over the Brussels sprouts.
  - Roast in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, turning halfway through the cooking time, until golden and lightly caramelized.
  - Serve immediately.
