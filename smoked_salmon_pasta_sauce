And if you're into pasta with salmon, you might want to try to make a sauce out of it. Take a smoked salmon fillet and cut it into pieces, then heat some olive oil or butter (or a mix of the 2, don't overdo with the quantity) and add the pieces of salmon to it. When it is almost done changing color, add a shot of vodka in the pan and let it evaporate: this will take out the salt and the flavour from the smoked salmon and help cook it through.
Once it has completely evaporated, add enough cream to cover it all (I use a 200ml pack), stir and remove from heat. Cream must not boil. Now add pepper, and salt if needed.
Meanwhile cook your pasta of choice and then add the sauce to the cooked pasta. This is all very quick (it can be done in the time needed to boil the water and cook the pasta, and you'll still have time to clean your kitchen in the wait), and very much tasty.
